#Answer: 1864 to 2019

#2 - Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. How many games
did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played?

SELECT nameFirst, nameLast, teamID, height, G_all
FROM people
INNER JOIN appearances
ON people.playerID = appearances.playerID
WHERE height IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY height;
SELECT name
FROM teams
WHERE teamID = 'SLA';

#Answer: Eddie Gaedel, height = 43, G_all = 1

#3 - Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. Create a list
showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the
major leagues.

#Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player
earned the most money in the majors?

SELECT schoolID
FROM schools
WHERE name_full = 'Vanderbilt University';
SELECT people.nameFirst, people.nameLast, collegeplaying.schoolID, SUM(salary)
FROM people
INNER JOIN salaries ON salaries.playerID = people.playerID
INNER JOIN collegeplaying ON collegeplaying.playerID = people.playerID
WHERE collegeplaying.schoolID = 'vandy'
GROUP BY people.nameFirst,people.nameLast,schoolID
ORDER BY SUM(salary)desc;

#Answer: David Price earned the most at 245,553,888

#5 - Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. Round the
numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you
see any trends?

SELECT CONCAT(SUBSTRING(yearID, 1, 3), 0) AS decade,
ROUND(AVG(SO),2) AS strikeout,
ROUND(AVG(HR),2) AS homeruns
FROM pitching
WHERE (yearid*10)/10 >= 1920
GROUP BY decade;

#Answer: Baseball was desegregated in 1947, appearing to lead to a higher number of
strikeouts and home runs from 1960 onward.

#6 - Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where success is
measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful.
(A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) Consider
only players who attempted at least 20 stolen bases.

SELECT nameFirst,nameLast, SUCCESS
FROM(SELECT playerID, yearID, SB, ATTEMPTS, ROUND(SB/ATTEMPTS* 100,2) AS
SUCCESS
FROM(SELECT SB, yearID, playerID, SUM(SB + CS) AS ATTEMPTS
FROM batting
WHERE yearID =2016
GROUP BY SB, yearID, playerID) STOLEN
WHERE ATTEMPTS >= 20
ORDER BY SUCCESS DESC) STOLEN2
LEFT JOIN people
ON STOLEN2.playerID =people.playerID
ORDER BY SUCCESS DESC;

#Answer: Chris Owings has the most success at 91%

#8 - Using the attendance figures from the homegames table, find the teams and parks
which had the top 5 average attendance per game in 2016 (where average attendance is
defined as total attendance divided by number of games).
##Only consider parks where there were at least 10 games played. Report the park name,
team name, and average attendance. Repeat for the lowest 5 average attendance.

SELECT t.name, p.parkname, h.attendance, h.games,
ROUND(CAST(h.attendance as dec) / CAST(h.games as dec), 1) as avg_attendance
FROM homegames h
LEFT JOIN parks p ON h.parkkey = p.parkkey
LEFT JOIN teams as t ON t.yearid = h.yearkey AND h.teamkey = t.teamid
WHERE yearid = 2016 AND h.games >= 10
ORDER BY avg_Attendance desc;

#Answer: Dodgers, Cardinals, Blue Jays, Giants, and Cubs

Group 1: Is there any correlation between number of wins and team salary? Use data
from 2000 and later to answer this question. As you do this analysis, keep in mind that
salaries across the whole league tend to increase together, so you may want to look on a
year-by-year basis.

SELECT s.yearid, s.teamid, t.name, team_salary, t.w as wins
FROM (SELECT salaries.yearid, salaries.teamid, SUM(salary) as team_salary
FROM salaries
WHERE salaries.yearid >= 2000
GROUP BY salaries.yearid, salaries.teamid) s
LEFT JOIN teams t on s.teamid = t.teamid AND s.yearid = t.yearid
ORDER BY name;

#Answer: After pulling this report and exporting to Python to visualize, I cannot tell that
there is a strong trend in salary to wins. There are teams that are paid significantly more
but they seem to have a relatively even chance of winning compared to other teams. The
main thing we can determine from this is that the salary of the team is based on other
factors. We did note that a series of high win years in a row could create a boost in pay
but that did not necessarily result in continue
